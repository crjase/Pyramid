# How-To
This is source code, but if you go into the folder bin > Dotnet6.0, you will find a compiled build to directly run.
Once you get the program running, just enter a number (recommended: 1,000 max) and a pyramid with a height of <number> decending will appear in Output.txt.

# Warning
If you enter a number that is greater than 10,000, you may get an "out of memory" error. This is because I havn't added a way to free memory, I'm not bothered.
